# Homework6-WeatherDashboard
In this week's challenge we will be utilizing what we learned during week 6 about server side API's and build an application that utilizes the third-party API, OpenWeather, to retrieve weather data for cities and displays the weather (temperature, humidity, wind speed) of the current day and the weather (temperature and humidity) for the five following days.
